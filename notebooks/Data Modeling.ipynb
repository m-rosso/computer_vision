The data used here is made upon *2527 different images of garbage from 6 different classes*: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash. The ultimate goal is to develop an image classifier model that, after trained and validated using specific datasets, is able to predict the probabilities that a given image belongs to each of those classes. Again, a specific test dataset is applied to evaluate model performance. To achieve that goal, different code artifacts were generated:\n","* Python modules for image processing and to support model development.\n","* Notebooks of data engineering and data preparation that apply different operations over images (flip, crop, change in brightness, and so on).\n","* Notebooks of data modeling that implement experimentation to find the best image classifier model, analysis of the most relevant models and creation of codes to apply the best one in production."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"tRSIHB_5-OV-","metadata":{"id":"tRSIHB_5-OV-"},"source":["-----------"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"622ca833","metadata":{"id":"622ca833"},"source":["This notebook imports training, validation and test images, then applies some data preparation procedures (image scaling, data augmentation).
